this happens sometimes mainly when you don't have certain package installed

Looking for STARPU - not found using PkgConfig.
   Perhaps you should add the directory containing libstarpu.pc
   to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.
CMake Error at cmake_modules/morse_cmake/modules/find/FindSTARPU.cmake:442 (message):
  starpu_config.h has not been found while required to get StarPU version
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:619 (find_package)
  
$ sudo apt-get install libstarpu-1.3 libstarpu-dev
http://starpu.gforge.inria.fr/#software

you can just add/install such package in ubuntu in root folder to get it work perfect with cmake


If you can't find certain package, then define some macros, and comment the find_package.
