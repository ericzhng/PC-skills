Building and Installing (recommended)
Uninstall the default version provided by Ubuntu's package manager:

sudo apt remove cmake
sudo apt purge --auto-remove cmake
Go to the official CMake webpage, then download and extract the latest version. Update the version and build variables in the following command to get the desired version:

version=3.11
build=1
mkdir ~/temp
cd ~/temp
wget https://cmake.org/files/v$version/cmake-$version.$build.tar.gz
tar -xzvf cmake-$version.$build.tar.gz
cd cmake-$version.$build/
Install the extracted source by running:

./bootstrap
make -j4
sudo make install
Test your new cmake version.

$ cmake --version
Results of cmake --version:

cmake version 3.11.X

CMake suite maintained and supported by Kitware (kitware.com/cmake).
