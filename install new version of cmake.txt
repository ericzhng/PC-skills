version=3.14
build=5
mkdir ~/temp
cd ~/temp
wget https://cmake.org/files/v$version/cmake-$version.$build-Linux-x86_64.sh 
sudo mkdir /opt/cmake
sudo sh cmake-$version.$build-Linux-x86_64.sh --prefix=/opt/cmake
B-3. Add the installed binary link to /usr/local/bin/cmake by running this:

sudo ln -s /opt/cmake/bin/cmake /usr/local/bin/cmake
B-4. Test your new cmake version as in A-4.

Note
In 3.14.X the X represents the last part of the version that we defined as build. The build may change if cmake is updated. According to the official webpage the Latest Release is 3.14.5. If you want the Previous Release 3.13.5 just replace the version and build parameters like this:

version=3.13
build=5
