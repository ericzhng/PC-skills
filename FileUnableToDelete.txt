When Win10 and ubuntu are used together, such as using dual system or WSL in windows;
File systems sometimes can be confused and resulting in "Directory not empty‚Äù error.

Tried to delete in Windows and WSL, both didn't work.

Now the solution is:

switch to windows cmd, and run

chkdsk
chkdsk /F

After the commands finish, you should be able to delete the files safely.
